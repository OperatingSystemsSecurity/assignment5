# 1
If you do not use `bash` as your shell, to chroot into the Debian folder, run `chroot debian /bin/sh`, to avoid errors like this:

`chroot: failed to run command ‘/usr/bin/zsh’: No such file or directory`

If you use a Linux distribution that does not have Debian's executable folders in its `PATH`, you will have trouble running any commands. To rectify the problem, run `export PATH=$PATH:/usr/sbin/:/sbin:/bin`. After that you should be able to run commands like `ls` and `cd` like normal.

We followed the provided instructions, but they contain an error. We had to use `chroot` in place of `chdir` at step 5. After this change, breaking the chroot jail worked flawlessly. We included the source code and Makefile we used.
